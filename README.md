# A-B Tech Capstone Project - Your Movie Club
Your Movie Club is an A-B Tech school capstone project by Justin Hochschild. The site was built using PHP, CSS, and Javascript. The main goal of this project is to create a site that persists user created data using a database and offers views based on user credentials.

## What This Site Does
Your Movie Club is a website where users can create movie clubs to share with their friends and family. The site features a way to search for movies through a third party api by [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) (The Movie Database). The site also allows users to filter through movies based on popularity, genre, and watch providers. Members can add movies to a movie club queue and club members can comment on the current movie being viewed in the club. Admins of the site can view all of the users on the site and see all of the movie clubs that each user has created.

## Future Features to Implement
- Add a Person page so that users can view more about the actors in movies and see other movies that the actor has been in
- Add the ability to search and add TV shows to watch queues
- Allow users to add their own avatar images
- Add more filter options to the Discover page

## Hosting
Your Movie Club is hosted on a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet running a LAMP server. I chose to host the site with Digital Ocean to help me gain a better understanding of the underlying structures of a webserver. Digital Ocean offers many well documented guides on setting up and trouble shooting a webserver.
